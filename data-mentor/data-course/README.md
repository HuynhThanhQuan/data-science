## Introduction

This course is designed to provide a hands-on and practical approach to data science, focusing on real-world applications in the financial sector. By exploring three key use cases—Credit Scoring, Fraud Detection, and Customer Personalization—participants will gain valuable insights and skills to address challenges commonly encountered in the industry.

## Use Cases

### Credit Scoring

In this module, we delve into the world of Credit Scoring, exploring predictive modeling techniques to assess the creditworthiness of individuals. Participants will learn to build robust credit scoring models and evaluate their effectiveness in predicting credit risk.

### Fraud Detection

The Fraud Detection use case equips participants with the knowledge and tools to identify anomalous patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. Through various machine learning and data analysis techniques, participants will develop effective fraud detection models.

### Customer Personalization

This module focuses on enhancing the customer experience through personalized recommendations and tailored services. Participants will explore methods to analyze customer behavior, predict preferences, and implement strategies for effective customer personalization.
